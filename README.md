Assignment: Layout &amp; Positioning

Demonstrating 3 different ways of centering content on the page.
The first way using absolute position requires a mathematical adjustment to align properly due to the edge of the box going to the center of the page.

The second way using flexbox allows simple adjustments and centering on either axis based on the flow of the direction.

The third way using text-align is limited in the fact that it only adjusts the text within the container. Elements such as the numbering from the lists is not included, as displayed in the page.
